With the Embedded SDK, your app can verify a user's identity using the Email Authenticator. You can integrate the email enrollment and challenge flows in your app and complete those flows using magic links, OTP, or a combination of both. Use this guide to learn how.

### Discover the convenience of magic links

When using OTP, a user must switch between your app to their email, find the OTP, switch back to your app again, type in the OTP and hit submit to verify their identity. Compare this to using magic links where verification requires the user only to click a link in the email, which is a far quicker, more user-convenient, and yet still secure experience.
